# Introduction to Choropleth using R

How did a spend a Sunday afternoon? I went over [Ari Lamstein's](https://twitter.com/AriLamstein) email course and had fun creating choropleth. 

The code is uploaded to this repo and my explorations can be seen [here](http://rouseguy.github.io/Intro-to-Choropleth-using-R/)
